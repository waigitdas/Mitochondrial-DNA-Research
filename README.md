# Mitochondrial DNA Research
 
This project is focussed on mt-DNA evolution using graph methods.  

<h3>Phases</h3>
<ol>
<li>Creation of a <a href="https://github.com/waigitdas/Mitochondrial-DNA-Research/tree/main/Knowledge_Graph">knowledge graph</a> to evaluate the haplotree is common use (final stages; open for review and comment)</li> 
<li><a href="https://github.com/waigitdas/Mitochondrial-DNA-Research/tree/main/Topology">Topology</a> of the knowledge graph (in progress)</li> 
<li>Biological mechanisms producing the topology (in development)</li> 
</ol>
