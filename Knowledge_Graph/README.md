# Mitochondrial DNA Knowledge Graph
 
A mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) knowledge graph (KG) was constructed in sequential steps using a Neo4j native graph database. GenBank full sequences were loaded into mt_seq nodes, with their assigned haplogroup recorded as a property. The sequences were parsed using 40-base reference probes, producing in silico probes. Overlapping probes were stitched together, and flanking regions from the full sequences were incorporated to ensure unique targeting to homologous positions in the reference sequence. The alignment of probes with the homologous reference sequence enabled comparisons using the diff-match-patch (DMP) algorithm, facilitating the annotation of probes with variants. Relationships between mt_seq, probe, and variant nodes formed the core of the initial graph.

The mtDNA haplotree was loaded into the KG and used to generate a derivative descendancy graph, which replicated the haplotree’s branching structure while harmonizing haplogroup naming and pruning variants that were absent from the full sequence data. Discrepancies in variant assignments prevented consistent concordance between the sequence data and haplotree, with confidence decreasing at finer levels of resolution—while the model appears coherent at a high level, deeper analysis reveals increasing inconsistencies, culminating in only 3% of sequences containing all required variants for their assigned haplogroup. Analytical results were memorialized within the KG through the addition of new nodes, relationships, or properties.

A key finding was that most traversals from the haplotree root node (Eve) to the dnode representing the assigned haplogroup failed. These traversals depended on comparing the defining variants of each dnode to those observed in the test sequence, with failure indicating a lack of concordance. Identified causes included back mutations present in branch definitions but absent in the data, errors in variant annotation, and structural flaws in the haplotree model. While the model appears coherent at a high level, it breaks down when examined in detail—only 3% of sequences contain all required variants for their assigned haplogroup. The KG thus provides a robust framework for future research into mtDNA classification and variant interpretation. Constructed using brute force analytics, it produces precise results, many of which are memorialized within the graph. Provenance is robustly represented in properties, ensuring concordance of results with the original sources. Additionally, the KG’s structure allows for systematic exploration of discrepancies, offering insights into variant reliability and haplogroup classification accuracy.
