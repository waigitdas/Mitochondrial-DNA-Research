# Probe Precision
 
The in silico probes used in this studies were developed using brute force methods. Their precision was demonstrated by their accuracy in identifying the homologous position in Genbank sequences. Over 99% of probe matches occurred within a narrow frameshft from the expected targetted position. These is expected because the homologous region position is offset from the reference sequence by differing insertions and deletions.
