# Probe Precision
 
The in silico probes used in this studies were developed using brute force methods. Their precision was demonstrated by their accuracy in identifying the homologous position in Genbank sequences. Over 99% of probe matches occurred within a narrow frameshft from the expected targetted position. These is expected because the homologous region position is offset from the reference sequence by differing insertions and deletions.

Probes have greater specificity than individual variants because probes include unique sets of adjacent variants.The haplottree is defined by variants that may define multiple branches. In all cases, probes including the defining variant are different and distinct for a single haplotree branch. 

Back mutations are at positions where there are probes targeting the homologous region. 

Probes identify mutations associated  with mitochondrial disorders at a frequrncy similar to that in screened populations.
