# Haplogroip Assignments
 
Haplogroup assignments were provided by the Mitomap team at Children's Hosdpital of Philadelphia. The used the Haplogrep3 tools. The assignments were added as a propterty to the Genbank sequence nodes. 

This project intended to replicate these assignmentsusing graph methods. That effort failed. The Excel workbooks in this folder Used traversals of the dnode (haplotree) paths from Eve to the assigned haplogroup node. show:

<ol>
 <li>Traversals to the assiggned hapolgroup node were successful foe only 34% of the Genbank sequences.</li>
 <li>The C16189T was a common "missed variant" and ignoring thisprwould increase the success rate to ~60%</li>
 <li>C16189T was frequenctly annotated andWhen the present methods identified the closely adjacent T16187d and 16188.1T variants </li>
