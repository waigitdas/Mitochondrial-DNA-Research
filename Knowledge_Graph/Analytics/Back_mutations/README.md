# Back Mutation

The Excel workbooks in this folderand their worksheets have the Cypher query and explanatory comments at the bottom.

Key takeaways are:
<ol>
 <li>Backmutation do not exist in the sequence annotations but are within the haplotree</li>
 <li>Back mutations were pruned from the dnode tree but a property was added at the node where they were removed to document the provenance of that change. </li>
 <li>Back muttaion impact 21% of the haplotree branches </li>
 <li>224 haplotree branches were defined only by backmutations and pruning them left no defining mutations. At these node there are 818 sequences assigned the haplogroup. </li>
 <li>There are 79,092 probe for the homologous regions of back mutations. They have annotated variants differing from the reference sequence. /li>
 <li>Back mutations are respnsible for many failed graph traversals fromEve to the assigned haplogroup nde.</li>
</ol>

In the data there is no difference between back mutations and missing variants. Both do not exist The analytical difference is that back mutations would persist in downstream branch definitions whereas missing mutations may not.
